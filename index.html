            <h3 class="mb-0">Predicting NHL Team Success</h3>
          <p>I have always had a love for hockey. I started skating at the age of two and have been hooked ever since. As a sports fan, I enjoy the game and love cheering for the Boston Bruins. As a data scientist, I was interested to look at the statistics and see if I could find regular season performance indicators that can predict post-season success. This is an age old problem that many have tried to solve, and a very challenging one at that. Using Python's BeautifulSoup library, I scraped 10+ years of team and individual player data from hockeyreference.com. There were 2 major challenges with this project: First, once I scraped the data I needed to get it into a format with which I could create a model. Second: I needed to decide what, exactly I was modeling. As it turns out, the answer to problem 2 determined the answer to problem one as well.<p>
          <p>Initially, I had planned to simply predict who would win the Stanley Cup based on this regular season data. After some initial data analysis, I realized that this presented one major challenge. When dealing with sports data, particularly when analyzing team statistics, every year must be handled as a stand-alone data set. This means that the data I would feed my model would only have 30 'observations' for every year. Over a ten year period this equates to only 300 observations. This is not a lot of data, and to make matters worse, only 10 of those observations would fall into a 'positive' class. This presents a huge problem of unbalanced classes, which with that small of a dataset is very difficult to overcome.<p>
          <p>I proceeded by switching focus and making this a multiclass classification problem. Rather than just predicting who would win the Stanley Cup, I decided to rank each team in every year and attempt to predict how each team would perform in the playoffs. The end result is a model that predicts a 'rank' for each playoff team, along with a probability, or how 'confident' the model is in its prediction.<p>
          <p>While this model is certainly not perfect, I have had some encouraging results early on. In one of my test years, the model predicted both teams that would make the Stanley Cup Final, although it was unable to predict the winner. I definitely intend to build on this foundation and tweak this project over time.</p>
          <p>This project was certainly challenging, but it gave me a great opportunity to play around with the data and really think about what makes a team "good". I began to develop my own statistics that I felt were not entirely captured in the data I had. One specific statistic I created is called Balanced Scoring. To do this, first I dropped all goaltenders from my data and any skaters that had played in less than 10 games. Next, I found the mean of points scored for the remaining players in a given year. Next, I grouped all of the players who scored points totaling one standard deviation above the mean into a group called "High Scorers." Finally, I represented the number of each of those players on a given team as a percentage of that teams roster. Here is a nice visualization of that data:<p>

          <p>Reddit is a popular social media platform. Self proclaimed as, "The Front Page of the Internet," Reddit functions as a message board where users can share their thoughts, articles, comments and of course, memes, on a wide variety of subjects. Reddit is organized by topics into pages known as 'subreddits.' The topics discussed in these subreddits range from very general, like 'news' and 'politics', to extremely specific and obscure, like 'Animals Without Necks.' The latter is literally just a collection of photos of animals who look like they don't have necks. Ahh, the glory of the internet. How far we've come.<p>
          <p>The idea behind this project is to analyze real and satirical news headlines in an effort to understand how similar these headlines can actually sound. The goal is to examine a large dataset of news headlines, and using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning models, predict if a given headline is from a real news source or a satirical news source.<p>
            <h5>The Problem:</h5>
          <p>Over the past few years, and especially since the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, concern has grown around the legitimacy of news stories circulating on social media. The term 'fake news' is often applied to these erroneous or misleading news stories (admittedly, this term is thrown around loosely and judging which stories are 'fake' is often a matter of political affiliation). Regardless of political affiliation, I am interested in exploring ways to more quickly and accurately identify and denounce truly fake and misleading news stories in wide circulation on social media. In this examination we will mainly be focused on 2 specific 'subreddits.' Our satirical news source is 'The Onion' subreddit and our real news source is the 'not the onion' subreddit.<p>
            <h5>The Subreddits:</h5>
          <p>The Onion is a well known humor and satire site, famous for creating entirely fake and funny news stories. While most people are aware that the Onion is a satire site, replies from individuals who seem to take these news stories as real stories can still be found all over the internet. Not the Onion is a subreddit devoted to real news stories from reliable news sources, that sound like they could be Onion articles.<p>
            <h5>The Dataset:</h5>
          <p>Using Reddit's API I have scraped 3,453 unique posts from 'The Onion' subreddit and 3,249 unique posts from the 'Not the Onion' subreddit. The Onion represents 51.5% of the total data, which means we have a very balanced dataset.
            <h5>Findings:</h5>
          <p>I tried two classification models in this project. First, I fit a Random Forest and used GridSearching to tune certain hyperparameters. This model acheived an accuracy score of 77.7%. Next, I wanted to try a trusty old Logistic Regression, which actually performed better than the Random Forest, with an accuracy score of 79%. While these models perform considerably better than the baseline prediction of 51.5% percent, I would be interested to dig deeper into stemming, lemmatizing and stop words.<a href="https://github.com/cmanley10/NLP-with-Reddit" target="_blank"> Check out Github for more.</a></p>
            <h3>Tableau Specialization</h3>
          <p>I am currently working towards completing a specialization entitled 'Data Visualization with Tableau.' This Specialization is offered by Coursera via the University of California Davis. There are 5 courses in this specialization totaling roughly 200 hours of study and project work. The specialization focuses on building skill in Tableau with a strong foundation in data visualization theory and technique. The specialization progresses from basic design principles, to visual analytics, KPIs and dashboards and visual storytelling. The specialization culminates with a final portfolio project to be displayed on Tableau Public. I am nearly done with the coursework and will begin this final project in the coming weeks. I will share a few visualizations I have created thus far here. Additionally, I'll include a link to my Tableau Public Profile.<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/chris.manley#!/" target="_blank"> Check out Tableau for more.</a></p><p>
            <h5>The Sample Superstore Dataset</h5>
          <p>Throughout the Tableau course we have used the Sample Superstore Dataset to create visualizations and dashboards. This dataset contains information from a fictional wholesale retailer. There is product, sales, profit, region, discount, transaction, and customer information available in the dataset. From there we have created additional calculated fields and KPIs to better understand the performance of the business. The particular dashboard below looks at summary data for individual customers. Take a look at the filters and interactive features to better understand relationships.<p>
